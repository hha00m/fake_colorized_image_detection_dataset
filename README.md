# Fake Colorized Images

## Overview
This repository contains code for generating fake colorized images. The process involves three main steps: dataset generation, algorithm execution, and result visualization.

## How to Run
To execute the code, please follow the steps below in sequence:

1. **Generate the Dataset**: Run the script responsible for creating or loading the dataset that will be used for colorization.
2. **Execute the Algorithm**: Once the dataset is ready, execute the algorithm that applies the colorization technique.
3. **Plot the Results**: After the colorization process is complete, run the plotting script to visualize the results.
